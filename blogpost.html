            <p>Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia that anyone can edit, and millions already have.

                Wikipedia's purpose is to benefit readers by presenting information on all branches of knowledge. Hosted
                by
                the Wikimedia Foundation, it consists of freely editable content, whose articles also have numerous
                links to
                guide readers towards more information.

                Written collaboratively by largely anonymous volunteers known as Wikipedians, Wikipedia articles can be
                edited by anyone with Internet access, except in limited cases where editing is restricted to prevent
                disruption or vandalism. Since its creation on January 15, 2001, it has grown into the world's largest
                reference website, attracting over a billion visitors monthly. Wikipedia currently has more than
                sixty-three
                million articles in more than 300 languages, including 6,835,818 articles in English, with 118,331
                active
                contributors in the past month.

                Wikipedia's fundamental principles are summarized in its five pillars. The Wikipedia community has
                developed
                many policies and guidelines, although editors do not need to be familiar with them before contributing.
